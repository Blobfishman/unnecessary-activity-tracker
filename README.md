# unnecessary-activity-tracker

A tool to identify and visualize necessary and unnecessary movement of people using positional data(e.g. anonymized cell phone data)

This project was made in 48h hours _from 20.3 to 22.3.20_ during the [#WirVsVirus](http://www.wirvsvirushackathon.org) -Hackathon, to contribute in finding solutions to the ongoing corona-crisis.
Also see the corresponding [devpost-page](https://devpost.com/software/0045_haustiere_handydaten)(in German).
Feel free to pull request and help continue the development of this tool!

### Dependencies
You'll need Python3.x and the following modules:
_overpy, numpy, pandas, geopandas, rtree_
You can install them using pip or anaconda!

## Generating the Infrastructure
A Shape File of the grid(the _.shp, .dbf, .shx_ files), and a Table with tagweights.
(You could also use a single _.geojson_ files in all commands instead of _.shp_ files)

With the files in the same folder you may generate the infrastructure score for all grids by running
```
python3 grid_infra_score_gen.py GRID.shp TAG_WEIGHTS.csv INFRA_SCORES.shp
```
Keep in mind that this generates 5 filetypes: _.cpg, .dbf, .prj, .shp, .shx_
If you set this Tool up on a server, you might consider running this very rarely, because the infra_score won't change much over time.


## Generating the Shape File
If you got your files(especially the _.shp and .shx_) you can generate the final scores by executing
```
python3 main.py GRID.shp INFRA_SCORES.shp POINTS.shp POINTS_BACKGROUND.shp SCORES_FINAL.shp
```
Where POINTS.shp is the Shape File for the Location-Data, and POINTS_BACKGROUND.shp is the background noise of given Point distribution.(e.g. at night)
This generates 5 filetypes(_.cpg, .dbf, .prj, .shp, .shx_) for the Shape file with values 
* **geometry** The Grids geometries to display in any compatible program 
* **val** The calculated value of unnecessary-movement calculated with _val(pop, infra)= pop^infra + pop_
* **pop** The calculated value of movement
* **infra** The generated values for the surrounding infra structure
By specifying a different file extension for the output file to _.geojson_, a .geojson with the given data ready to display with web-frontend APIs(e.g. Leaflet, OpenLayers)


## No files? We have example data
We ran the analysis for a Heidelberg, Germany.
You can use the grid file found in `assets`.

Feel also free to use the hand-crafted `tagweights.csv`.
